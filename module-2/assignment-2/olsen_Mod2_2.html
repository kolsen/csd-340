	<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
	<p class="intro">Hey there! I call Wisconsin my home sweet home. Before diving into the exciting world of software development, I actually used to be a youth pastor. 
	Can you believe it? <span class="sentence">Fast forward to today, and I've been crafting code and chasing programming challenges for a good 8 years now.</span> and am now currenlty pursuing my Bacholor's degree.</p>
	<p>I'm a proud owner of a duo of dogs, a charming cat, and not one, but two fish tanks. Back in the day, I was the proud overseer of a small underwater 
	empire with 7 larger 55-gallon fish tanks. But life's all about balance, so I've scaled things down a bit since then.</p>
	<p>Now, let's talk about some serious fun! I'm all about those board games and tabletop adventures. 
	Think strategy, think excitement. Games like Scythe, Risk, and Stratego are right up my alley. But, that's not all – I'm a sucker for role-playing too. Dungeons & Dragons and Gloomhaven are 2 of my favorites</p>
	<p>When the sun's shining and the days are longer, you'll find me in my element. I absolutely live for summers in Wisconsin, especially because it means fishing and soaking up the great outdoors. 
	Here's the kicker: I've got a secret weapon when it comes to cooking. I'm all about smoking meats and grilling up a storm.p>
